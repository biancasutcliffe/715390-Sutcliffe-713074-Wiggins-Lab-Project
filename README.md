This repository contains the source code used for the laboratory project titled 'Voice conversion of a synthetically generated voice'. The training and testing audio data used is located in the folder Voices_233. The folder Audio Results contains the re-synthesised audio results from the Gaussian Mixture Model and Linear Regression voice conversion mapping functions. 

Running the code can be done in two ways. The first is to run the file Voice_Conversion.m, which will run both the Gaussian Mixture Model as well as the Linear Regression code. If the individual voice conversion mapping functions would like to be run independently, the files Gaussian_Mixture_Model_Mapping.m and Linear_Regression.m can be run.

The folder titled Minutes contains the weekly meeting minutes with the project supervisor Professor David Rubin.
